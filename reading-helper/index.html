        <p>
            Reading Helper is a training app designed to help students
            improve real-world reading speed and accuracy, especially
            for tests like the ACT and SAT.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app is built around short, focused exercises that train
            eye quickness, attention, and comprehension without distractions.

        <h2>Flash Trainer</h2>
        <p>
            The Flash Trainer briefly shows words and phrases on the screen,
            then asks the student to type exactly what they saw.
        </p>
        <ul>
           <li>Levels from 4-letter words up to longer 20–30+ character phrases</li>
           <li>Adjustable flash duration and accuracy tracking</li>
           <li>Automatic level progression as students improve</li>
           <li>
               Includes both familiar phrases and “non-intuitive” combinations,
               so the brain cannot simply guess from context
           </li>
        </ul>

            <li>Detail questions (what did the passage say?)</li>
            <li>Inference questions (why did this happen? what can we conclude?)</li>
        </ul>
